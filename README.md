# ArcForge: Fine-Tuning on Intel Battlemage GPUs

ArcForge is an open-source toolkit for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using Intel Arc™ Battlemage and other next-generation Intel GPUs. It integrates cutting-edge tools like HuggingFace Transformers, Intel IPEX-LLM, and QLoRA/LoRA methods to deliver scalable, efficient training pipelines optimized for the Intel XPU architecture.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Enable high-performance fine-tuning of open-weight LLMs on Intel GPUs
- Provide end-to-end workflows for QLoRA and LoRA with checkpointing, evaluation, and inference
- Support for modern instruction-tuning datasets (Alpaca, OpenOrca, etc.)
- Serve as a foundational framework for building ML infra on Intel's Battlemage GPUs

## 🧩 Key Features

- ✅ LoRA and QLoRA fine-tuning on LLaMA 2/3 models
- ✅ HuggingFace Transformers integration
- ✅ Intel IPEX-LLM acceleration for Arc GPUs
- ✅ Alpaca-compatible training datasets
- ✅ Efficient checkpointing, evaluation, and inference
